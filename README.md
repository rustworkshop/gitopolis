# Gitopolis

[![Rust](https://github.com/timabell/gitopolis/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/timabell/gitopolis/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Manage multiple git repositories, like [gita](https://github.com/nosarthur/gita) but written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) so you don't need python etc to run it.

It's intended to not know too much about git and just delegate everything to the `git` command which assumed to be available on the path.

## The name

Think a [metropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis) of git repos.

It's a lot to type as a name, but it's nice and unique, and if you use it a lot I suggest you create a shell alias to something shorter.

## License

To be decided

## Usage

```sh
mkdir ~/repos/
cd ~/repos/
git clone https://github.com/timabell/gitopolis.git
git clone https://github.com/timabell/gitopolis.git gitopolis-my-fork
git clone https://github.com/timabell/schema-explorer.git
git clone https://github.com/timabell/dotmatrix tims-dotmatrix

# tell gitopolis to track all the repos in the current directory
gitopolis add *

# repos in nested folders
mkdir thoughtbot
git clone https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles.git thoughtbot/dotfiles
gitopolis add thoughtbot/dotfiles

# run commands in all managed repos
gitopolis exec git status
gitopolis exec du -sh .

# put repos into groups
gitopolis group tim add gitopolis schema-explorer tims-dotmatrix
gitopolis group dotfiles add tims-dotmatrix thoughtbot/dotfiles

# list repo groups and the repos in them
gitopolis group list

# run a command in all of one group
gitopolis group tim exec git pull
gitopolis group tim exec du -sh .
```

Groups are like tags, a repo can be in as many groups as you like.

It currently assumes that it can just grab the url for `origin`, we could add support for multiple origins and different naems later.

Command used to show status is currently hard-coded, we could make that configurable later.

### Command hierarchy

`help` / `--help` / `-h` which prints usage.

```
* gitopolis  # prints usage info
	* help / --help / -h (default) - print usage
	* add <folder(s)...>  # add one or more git repos to manage
	* remove <folder(s)...>  # remove one or more git repos from repo management
	* exec -- <command> <args...>  # execute any shell command in the repo (including git commands)
	* list  # list all managed repos and their state
	* clone  # clone any repositories that are managed but don't exist locally
	* group  # prints subcommnd help
		* group <group_name> # list and show state for repos in this group
		* group <group_name> exec # as per main exec command but limited to a group
		* group <group_name> add # add repo to this group
		* group <group_name> remove # remove repo from this group
		* group <group_name> list # list groups & their repos and their state
		* group list # list groups and the repos in them
```

Currently need `--` after exec to avoid git args being interpreted by the rust arg parser. Hope to fix that and just consume everything after exec. 

## Config format

The repo list + groupings are stored in a toml file in the current folder called `.gitopolis.toml` that looks like this:

```toml
[[repos]]
path = "schema-explorer"
remotes = { origin = "https://github.com/timabell/schema-explorer.git" }
groups = ["tim"]

[[repos]]
path = "tims-dotmatrix"
remotes = { origin = "https://github.com/timabell/dotmatrix" }
groups = ["tim", "dotfiles"]
```

The double-square-bracket is the [array of tables toml markup](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#array-of-tables).

## Setting sync

In the manner of dotfiles, you can symlink, check-in and/or sync the config that gitopolis uses so that you can version control it and use it across multiple machines.

gitopolis creates a `.gitopolis` file in the current working directory (expected to be the parent folder of the repos). We could make this more flexible in future but it'll do for now.
